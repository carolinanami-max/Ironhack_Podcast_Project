# Ironhack Mindfulness Podcast 🎙️🧘

Welcome to the Ironhack Mindfulness Podcast.

This project is an AI-powered meditation and affirmation generator designed to support learners during intensive learning journeys such as AI bootcamps, career transitions, and skill-building phases. The goal is to help users build mental resilience, focus, and confidence through guided affirmations transformed into calming audio experiences.

Today's meditation concept focuses on inner strength, clarity of mind, and the ability to learn with ease — helping participants feel grounded, capable, and at peace with the challenges ahead.

## 🌱 Project Overview

The Ironhack Mindfulness Podcast automatically transforms written affirmations or meditation notes into structured guided meditation audio.

The system demonstrates an end-to-end AI pipeline:

1. Accept input text (affirmations or meditation scripts)
2. Process and structure content using an LLM API
3. Generate audio using Text-to-Speech
4. Deliver the final meditation through a simple web interface

This project showcases how AI can be used not only for productivity, but also for mental well-being and personal growth.
