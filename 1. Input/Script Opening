Let's begin.
Find a comfortable position and gently close your eyes.
Bring your attention to your breath. Take a deep breath in through your nose... and exhale slowly through your mouth. Again, breathe in deeply... and let it all go. One more time, inhale... and exhale.
In a moment, I'll share affirmations with you. After each one, there will be a pause for you to repeat it, either silently or aloud.
You are ready.
